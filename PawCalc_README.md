# PawCalc

PawCalc is an app that calculates how old a dog is in human years to the months and days as well.
It calculates how old a dog is by using the ratio of 1 dog year = 7 human years.

The motivation for building this app was to learn Jetpack Compose while using clean architecture and modularization.
